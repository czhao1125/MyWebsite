              My project is a Financial Recorder. The purpose of this project is to record the userâ€™s expenditures
               and income deposits. When a user input the date, store, product, price of the purchase or the money
                he/she earned, it is going to calculate how much money he/she have left. It can also be used as a
                 tracker of the expenditures as there is an option to view all the records. It can be used by people
                  who want to keep track of their money and expenditures, or simply by whom want to see how much money
                   they have left. This project interests me because I must give one of these lists to my dad every month
                    since he pays all my bills. It is sometimes very difficult to keep track of all the records and very
                     time-consuming. Thus, if I can design a financial recorder myself, it would save me a lot of time
                      and easier to use than the notebook on my phone.
