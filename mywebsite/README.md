## Customization Guide for the template

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, so feel free to change whatever doesn't suit you need.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons, but feel free to use fontawesome or any other icon library you want.

For the form submission, formspree was used. You can get a hands-on tutorial on how to use formspree by watching this [YouTube video](https://formspree.io/). Submissions will be delivered straignt into the specified Gmail account.

In addition to formspree, you can also use Netlify form submission in case you deploy there. Brad Traversy has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElQ689HRcY) on how to do it.

If you encounter problems customizing, reach out to me by sending me a DM on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/koladechris).
