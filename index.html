        Welcome to my website. I'm a second-year undergraduate at University of British Columbia, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I’m seeking intern and co-op software engineering opportunities for Summer 2023 and Fall 2023 in the tech industry.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p id="text1">
        I have always been intrigued by solving difficult problems since I was little. And my father, who graduated from Computer Science at U of T and became a programmer, would always "brainwash" me on how computer science is better and more interesting than any other field of study. I, of course, did not believe him. However, I still decided to take a few computer science courses during my first year to try them out. After taking the courses, it quickly captured my heart, and that is when I realized, I want to become a software developer, just like my dad. In addition, some parts of me also believed that I got the genes for computer science from my dad, so it might be easier for me to learn Computer Science than to learn Economics.
