        <p class="bio-text">
          Welcome to my website. Let me start by introducting myself. I am Crystal, a 
          second year combined major of computer science and statistics student at UBC, who wants
          to be a software developer.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, this is still Crystal. Some may ask, why software developer?
         I have always been intrigued by solving difficult problems since I was little. And my
         father, who graduated from Computer Science at U of T and became a programmer, would always "brainwash" me
         on how computer science is better and more interesting than any other fields of study. I, of course, did
         not believe him. However, I still decided that I will take a few computer science courses during my first year
         to try it out. After taking the courses, it quickly captured my heart, and that is when I realized, I want
         to become a software developer, just like my dad. In addition, some part of me also believed that I got the genes
         for computer science, so it might be easier for me to learn CS than to learn ECON.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little fun fact about me, I love drawing and painting. Although I have always went on and on about
         how I want to become a software developer that works at Google or Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook
         or basically any big fancy companies, I actually love drawing and painting more than coding. That is
         the first thing or in fact, the only thing, I am good at. I started drawing and painting since little,
         but my mom always thought piano is better, so I took piano classes every week, instead of art classes.
         However, after 3 years of learning piano painfully and still can not play one entire song, my mom
         fianlly realzed that music is probably not my strength (and even until today, my mom still tells me that she
         regrets forcing me learning piano, which she should've let me took art classes). But I did a lot of art works
         in past few years, and if you would like to see them, click at the right top corner on this website
         that says "My Artworks". And maybe tell me if you think I am good at it or not:) 
         Little Side note: I will get offended so you better say something nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than coding, drawing and painting, I also love eating, travelling around, shopping, and watching movies.
        My favorite movie is definitely going to be Top Gun, if you have not watched Top Gun before, you have to, it is
        the best movie like ever. Best place to travel to? Spain of course. Best place to shop? Holt Renfrew. Best Place
        to eat? Havn't found one because I love all types of food.
