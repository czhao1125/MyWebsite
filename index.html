          Welcome to my website. Let me start by introducting myself. I am Crystal, a 
          second year combined major in computer science and statistics student at UBC, who wants
          to be a software developer.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, this is still Crystal. Some may ask, why software developer?
         I have always been intrigued by solving difficult problems since I was little. And my
         father, who graduated from Computer Science at U of T and became a programmer, would always "brainwash" me
         on how computer science is better and more interesting than any other field of study. I, of course, did
         not believe him. However, I still decided to take a few computer science courses during my first year
         to try them out. After taking the courses, it quickly captured my heart, and that is when I realized, I want
         to become a software developer, just like my dad. In addition, some parts of me also believed that I got the genes
         for computer science from my dad, so it might be easier for me to learn Computer Science than to learn Economics.
